## Styling
The `vc-keypad` component uses [CSS part](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part) to apply custom styles.

Here are two diagram that labels the parts of the component as well as the default style:

![Diagram labeling the parts of the component](vc-keypad-style-diagram-1.jpg "Diagram labeling the parts of the component")

To style the input display, the part is "input".

Each row is labeled as "row". To style a specific row, the parts are labeled as "position1 position2 ... position5", i.e. "row position4".

![Diagram labeling the parts of the component](vc-keypad-style-diagram-2.jpg "Diagram labeling the parts of the component")

To apply a style to all buttons, target the part "button". Each button can be styled individually by adding its part "position1 position2 ... action cancel", i.e. "button position11".

Example:

```css
vc-keypad::part(row position4) {
  color: red;
  border: 2px green solid;
  font-size: 30px;
  display: none;
}

vc-keypad::part(button) {
  border-radius: 100%;
  width: 60px;
  height: 60px;
  background-color: black;
}

vc-keypad::part(button action) {
  border-radius: 6px;
  width: 100%;
  background-color: red;
}

vc-keypad::part(button position1) {
  display: none;
}

vc-keypad::part(button position3) {
  display: none;
}

vc-keypad::part(button position5) {
  display: none;
}

vc-keypad::part(button position7) {
  display: none;
}

vc-keypad::part(button position9) {
  display: none;
}
```

## Linting with ESLint, Prettier, and Types
To scan the project for linting errors, run
```bash
npm run lint
```

You can lint with ESLint and Prettier individually as well
```bash
npm run lint:eslint
```
```bash
npm run lint:prettier
```

To automatically fix many linting errors, run
```bash
npm run format
```

You can format using ESLint and Prettier individually as well

## Testing with Web Test Runner
To run the suite of Web Test Runner tests, run
```bash

```

To run the tests in watch mode (for &lt;abbr title=&#34;test driven development&#34;&gt;TDD&lt;/abbr&gt;, for example), run

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## Demoing with Storybook
To run a local instance of Storybook for your component, run
```bash
npm run storybook
```

To build a production version of Storybook, run
```bash
npm run storybook:build
```


## Tooling configs

For most of the tools, the configuration is in the `package.json` to reduce the amount of files in your project.

If you customize the configuration a lot, you can consider moving them to individual files.

## Local Demo with `web-dev-server`
```bash
npm start
```
To run a local development server that serves the basic demo located in `demo/index.html`
